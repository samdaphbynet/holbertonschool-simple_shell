# Simple Shell

#### Simple Shell is a command-line interpreter created as part of the Holberton School curriculum. It's a simplified version of the Unix shell, designed to handle basic commands and execute them in a similar way.

## Getting Started 

#### To use the Simple Shell, you must first clone the repository from Github to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/samdaphbynet/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git
```
#### Once you have the repository on your machine, navigate to the project directory:
```
$ cd holbertonschool-simple_shell
```
#### compile the files:
```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
### Usage

#### To run the Simple Shell, execute the following command:
```
$ ./hsh
```
#### The Simple Shell will then display a prompt, indicating that it is ready to receive input:
```
#cisfun$ 
```
#### You can then enter any command that you would normally use in a Unix shell. For example:
```
hsh$ ls
#cisfun$ exit
```
### Features
#### The Simple Shell is capable of handling basic Unix commands, such as:

`ls`
`pwd`
`env`
`exit`
#### The Simple Shell can also handle commands that require arguments, and can execute commands in the background. In addition, it supports pipes and redirection.
